## Building the APK

To generate a signed APK:

1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and modify the `signingConfigs` to match your release key details:
    ```gradle
    signingConfigs {
        release {
            storeFile file("your-release-key.keystore")
            storePassword "your-store-password"
            keyAlias "your-key-alias"
            keyPassword "your-key-password"
        }
    }
    ```

2. Generate the APK:
    ```bash
    cd android
    ./gradlew assembleRelease
    ```

The generated APK can be found in the `android/app/build/outputs/apk/release` folder.
